    <h2>Data Structure</h2>
    <p> <ul>
         <li>A computer program is a collection of instructions to perform a specific task. For this, a computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform computations on the data.</li>
         <li>A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.</li>
         <li> Data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification</li>
